 Our project focuses on the relationship between different socioeconomic variables and 
the percentage of green space in three different cities in California.
We used Landsat 8 data from between April 1st, 2020 and June 12st, 2020 in order to 
calculate the percent green space of San Diego, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. We did 
this by using the “red edge” that vegetation shows in the Near-Infrared wavelength. We 
chose images taken in the spring time because that is when the red edge is the clearest. 
We first downloaded images of our respective study sites from the USGS website, then 
used shapefile polygons of our cities in order to crop that data to just the relevant study 
site. Then, we used the bands to calculate NDVI of the sites.
We acquired census data for the different socioeconomic variables in the graphs and 
results
Our research questions were:
○ How do different socioeconomic variables affect the percentage of green space 
available within a city?
○ How are vulnerable populations affected by a lack of green space?
○ What is the statistical correlation between median income and percentage of green 
space available in a city?
○ Future work: How do different cities compare to the findings of these three California 
cities
